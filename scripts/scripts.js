The money should go to a worthy cause, a vector of benevolence to one in need. Hmmm, Abe would be better spent on the daily cappuccino instead of some homeless guy’s “food” (probably drugs). Besides, you need the caffeine. When the TV chances upon the news segment following the family under the bridge, you quickly change the channel; surely it’s more fun to watch the Splash Brothers rain threes than worry about those who, when it actually rains, shelter under the trees. The general consensus about homelessness, a dire issue deserving attention, is betrayed by the paradoxical reality: no one really cares. How many people realize the third armrest on park benches is a cruel architectural contraption, whose sole purpose is to dissuade sleepy nomads from a temporary bed? In our own community, city officials mention health and safety concerns as reasons to crack down on spontaneous homeless feedings at St. James Park, but is hunger not a health concern for the unsheltered multitude? Soup kitchens and homeless shelters are merely band-aids; only self-sustainment can surgically repair the deep wound and grant opportunity for new life. </p> <p> The 2017 San Jose Homeless Census and Survey reveals that, of those receiving government assistance, a vast majority of homeless received nutritional assistance (food stamps), financial assistance (General Assistance/CAAP), or medical assistance (Medicare). Yet with all this government support, 95% of those surveyed were unemployed, highlighting the need for a program to streamline the job search. Collaboration with minimum to near-minimum wage employers and a mini-application form provided when government benefits are collected could help those eligible quickly re-enter the workforce. Job-training immersions with local businesses that provide food and housing in return for work could equip trainees with valuable skills for an industry. Even a larger community outreach to inform the homeless could help them take advantage of already existing programs to get back on their feet.
